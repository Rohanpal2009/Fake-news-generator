# ðŸ“° Fake News Generator (Python)

This is a fun little Python project that generates random *fake news headlines* using lists of subjects, actions, and places/things.  
Every time you run the script, it creates a silly, random headline and asks if you want another one.

---

## ðŸš€ How it works
1. The program randomly picks:
   - A subject (like "Local man" or "Famous singer")
   - An action (like "dances with" or "declares war on")
   - A place or thing (like "aliens" or "flying pig at park")

2. Combines them into a funny headline.
